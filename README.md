# Betao - Product Designer Case
Thank you for your application to our Product Designer opening!

# Summary
This exercise is a practical case which involves reviewing, criticizing and highlighting areas of improvements of an existing design. This exercise is intentionally grounded in the reality of our work, as the design you'll be reviewing is taken directly from one of the earlier versions of our products.

While our products are currently tailored to a French audience, and the design and content reflect that, we encourage everyone to participate, regardless of their French language proficiency. If you come across unfamiliar words, feel free to use Google Translate for assistance. We don't restrict ourselves to hiring only French speakers for this role. Our designers always collaborate closely with their product managers to ensure cohesive copy. 

What we're seeking is someone with a discerning eye for layouts, colors, interactions, and simplicity. Through this exercise, we invite you to showcase all of your qualities and skills.
As we are mindful of our candidate's time, we voluntarily limit the size of the expected deliverables: keep in mind that there will be no "bonus" whatsoever for submissions that go beyond the limitations. We are aware that you will be working with very little context, and as such we are more interested in your thought process and reasoning behind your answers rather than their correctness.

# The Case
## The Flow
Betao's main product is an invoicing tool, and one of its main features is the ability for an user to create and edit an invoice. The process of editing  an invoice is multi-part, so we will narrow our focus down to on one particular interaction during the invoice creation process: the ability to pick or edit a recipient ("Client") for the invoice.

For this exercise, we will assume the user's need is to add any client to her invoice, in the fastest way possible.

In order to help you contextualize the following screenshots, we first would like you to watch two screen recordings:

Adding a new client to an invoice:

Associating a previously added client to the invoice, removing the client, adding another client, then editing the client: [adding-existing-client.webm](https://github.com/betaoab/betao-design-interview/assets/54904139/488053ae-4ed4-4e2a-aae0-e156a9ea8c58)

## Exercises
**For all the following questions, you are allowed to attach any images/diagrams/scribbles/handwriting to your submission, if they help illustrate your points.**

### 1. General aesthetics/Accessibility/UI Review
1.1 - In no more than 3 paragraphs (+optional images), please review the general aesthetics and the visual accessibility of the application shown above. Among your findings, what would you say is the one that should be prioritized first? Why? (Suggestions on how to solve any highlighted flaws are not expected in your answer.)

1.2 - In no more than 2 paragraphs (+optional images), please describe how you would structure your work if you were tasked to improve the general aesthetics of the application.

### 2. UX Review
Through the above screen recordings, you have seen how users can add, edit, remove a client from an invoice. 
Now, we invite you to review these three flows and identify the interactions that you believe requires the highest priority for improvement. Please explain your choice and the reasons behind it. Maximum 2 paragraphs (+images).
